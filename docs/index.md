# The MoMEMta project

**MoMEMta** is a C++ software package to compute Matrix Element weights. Designed in a modular way, it covers the needs of experimental analysis workflows at the LHC. MoMEMta provides working examples for the most common final states ($\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}$, WW, …). If you are an expert user, be prepared to feel the freedom of configuring your MEM computation at all levels!

MoMEMta is based on:

 - C++, [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/), [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) scripting language
 - [Cuba](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) (Monte-Carlo integration library)
 - External PDFs ([LHAPDF](http://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) by default)
 - External Matrix Elements (currently provided by our MadGraph C++ [exporter plugin](https://github.com/MoMEMta/MoMEMta-MaGMEE))
